# Cryptocurrency Staking Database and Analysis

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook and related materials for my master's thesis titled **"Cryptocurrency Staking Database and Analysis."** The notebook provides an in-depth analysis of staking mechanisms, particularly focusing on Tezos (XTZ), and explores various factors influencing the performance and rewards of Tezos bakers.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this notebook is to analyze the performance and behavior of bakers within the Tezos blockchain network. The analysis involves:

- Creating a comprehensive database of Tezos bakers.
- Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and relationships.
- Evaluating the staking offers and reliability of different bakers.
- Analyzing the delegation capacity and network share of bakers across multiple cycles.
- Providing insights and recommendations based on the analysis.

## Notebook Contents

### 1. **Introduction**
   - Overview of the cryptocurrency staking process.
   - Introduction to Tezos and its staking mechanisms.

### 2. **Data Collection and Preparation**
   - Description of the datasets used (`merged_baker_files.csv`, `merged_cycle_files.csv`).
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
   - **[Access the Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1njc2F8vt3D2AXB6EGL9EESDoUgj585at)**: The datasets used in this analysis can be accessed via this Google Drive link.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analysis of baker staking fees and KDE plot.
   - Correlation matrix analysis to identify relationships between different metrics.
   - Detailed analysis of delegation capacity vs. network share.
   - Violin plot of baker reliability scores.
   - Bakers' participation summary across different cycles.
   - Time-series analysis of delegation capacity for the top 10 bakers.

### 4. **Results and Findings**
   - Key insights derived from the analysis.
   - Comparative analysis of baker performance.
   - Discussion on the implications of the findings for stakeholders in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.
   - **[Full master thesis can be found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10_u8-unVk_W_6lTZ30My_n8HPvz9fRHBcpaG8s4lz9M/edit?usp=sharing)**

### 5. **Conclusion**
   - Summary of the research and analysis.
   - Recommendations for future work and further analysis.
